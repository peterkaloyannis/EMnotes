Heyo Everyone, It's me Peter!

Here is a repository I made for the notes I take in class starting from 11/09/19. It will be posted on the official github of the class so that
everyone has access to the notes. I will upload every day of notes with its date, and will probably forget every now and
then so just remind me by emailing me at panagiotis.kaloyannis@mail.mcgill.ca

If I for whatever reason miss a class, I will get the notes from someone else to put online.
If for whatever reason the notes are not legible or have a mistake, notify me at the same email and I will correct it.

**The first lecture notes were written by Itamar Aharony. You may find his contact information in the notes.
